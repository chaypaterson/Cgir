# CGI READER
-----------

This is a CGI script/simple web framework that prints pages in a directory (or
a text file, page by page), with some formatting options.

This Python script should:
    1. read a text file
    2. select a few lines of the file
    3. print a html page containing lines from the file, and some forward and
    back buttons.

That's it.

How to run:
    1. Place a text file in the cgi-bin/ directory.
    2. Start python -m CGIHTTPServer

That's it.
